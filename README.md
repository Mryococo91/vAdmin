Hello, this is a project which i have been working on for a little bit now, i wasn't planning on making it public but here we are, this is a NUI based Admin Menu built with React, Tailwind CSS and other technologies.

**[Script Information]**
1. Performance: Runs at 0.00 Resmon (Client).
2. Completely standalone meaning no other dependencies required.
3. Permission system is built around Ace Perms, originally it was built to use the Discord Rest API but i switched it for the public release.
4. If you would like to contribute, please go ahead and head over to the GitHub page and feel free to send a pull request.
