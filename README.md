[details="How does the permission system work?"]
It's fairly simple if you have experience with AcePerms before, it's just giving the player the specified ace perm from the config, but here is a [documentation](https://docs.badger.store/fivem-general-help/ace-permissions) that explains what Ace Permissions are and how to use them.
